# Luma Player

**Note: This npm package needs one of these dependencies: `vue >= v3.2` or `@vue/composition-api >= v1.1` as it
uses `@vueuse/core` in the background**


## Installing
Installing the Luma Player is as simple as running `npm install luma-player`, as you are used to :)


## Usage
Import the CSS in your `App.vue`:
```javascript
import "luma-player/dist/style.css";
```

And start using the Component where ever you like:
```javascript
import LumaPlayer from "luma-player";
```


## Key Features
- Built specifically for Vue, no weird `onMounted` shenanigans
- Highly reactive
- Lightweight
- Covers most edge cases


## Documentation
